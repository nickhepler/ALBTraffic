1.  Identify the thoroughfares that have the most and least number of accidents per 1,000 travelers.


## Methodology ##

## Data ##
### Source Data ###
The following data set was used in the analysis:
#### [Motor Vehicle Crashes - Case Information: Beginning 2009](https://data.ny.gov/api/views/e8ky-4vqe/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD) ####
Motor Vehicle Crashes - Case Information is one of four data sets related to motor vehicle crashes. The data set contains location information along with the date & time of accident, the type of accident, lighting and road conditions, and other variables. The data is provided by law enforcement agencies along with motorists reporting motor vehicle accidents to the Department of Motor Vehicles.


### Formatted Data ###
#### Summary ####
In order to ensure that the source data can be easily shared, computed, and analyzed, the data was processed and formatted using the R language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. The following is a brief summary of the changes made to produce the final formatted files.
1.  Data was downloaded, subset (to avoid GitHub upload limit), and saved to a new CSV file. To replicate, Windows users should user this [script](https://github.com/nickhepler/ALBTraffic/blob/master/scripts/download_mva_windows.R) whiles Linux & Mac users should use this [script](https://github.com/nickhepler/ALBTraffic/blob/master/scripts/download_mva_linux.R)

1.  The data was then sourced through the [format script](https://github.com/nickhepler/ALBTraffic/blob/master/scripts/format_mva.R) to perform a cursory review and format the data in order to complete statistical analysis.
